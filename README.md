# AI-Powered Accessible Learning Companion

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

An AI-driven learning assistant that personalizes educational content for students with disabilities, helping them overcome barriers to learning. The solution focuses on accessibility, adaptive pathways, and real-time feedback to promote inclusive education.

## Background

Many students with disabilities face challenges such as inaccessible materials, a lack of adaptive teaching methods, and insufficient support. Globally, over 240 million children live with disabilities, according to UNESCO. This project aims to provide them with equal access to education.

This is how these problems manifest:
* Limited access to tailored learning materials.
* Inadequate accessibility tools for diverse disabilities.
* Barriers to inclusive education, especially in under-resourced areas.

**Personal Motivation:** Bridging the gap in education accessibility is critical to empowering learners with disabilities and ensuring they can achieve their full potential.

## How is it used?

The AI-powered learning assistant can be deployed as:
1. A mobile app for self-paced learning at home.
2. A browser extension for online educational platforms.
3. A desktop application for school settings.

**Key Features:**
* Text-to-speech and speech-to-text for visually impaired learners.
* Real-time transcription and text simplification for cognitive disabilities.
* Adaptive quizzes and learning paths based on user performance.

**Target Users:**
* Primary: Students with disabilities (visual, auditory, cognitive, etc.).
* Secondary: Teachers and parents monitoring and supporting progress.

Here’s an example of how the app might work:
1. A visually impaired student uploads a textbook PDF.
2. The AI converts it to an audio format, simplifying complex passages as needed.
3. Real-time feedback guides the student’s progress.

## Data sources and AI methods

### Data Sources
* Open-source educational datasets like [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
* Accessibility guidelines from [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).
* User feedback data collected with informed consent to improve personalization.

### AI Techniques
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Simplify complex text, enable text-to-speech, and support sentiment analysis.
* **Computer Vision:** Convert images or scanned documents into accessible text.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Adapt learning paths based on user interaction.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Provide personalized recommendations and real-time progress feedback.

| Technique         | Purpose                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| NLP               | Simplify text, enable accessibility   |
| Computer Vision   | Image-to-text transcription           |
| Reinforcement Learning | Tailored learning pathways      |

## Challenges

What the project does _not_ solve:
* Addressing all disabilities effectively due to diverse needs.
* High cost of developing advanced accessibility features.
* Ensuring data privacy while collecting user feedback.

**Ethical Considerations:**
* Preventing AI bias in recommendations.
* Safeguarding user data and respecting privacy.

## What next?

To grow, the project could:
1. Expand to multiple languages and cultural contexts.
2. Partner with governments, NGOs, and schools for broader reach.
3. Enhance AI models with more training data and user feedback.

**Skills Needed:** Expertise in accessibility tools, partnerships for data collection, and funding to scale development.
